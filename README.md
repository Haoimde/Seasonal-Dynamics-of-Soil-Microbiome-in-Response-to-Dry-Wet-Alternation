Raw data for 'Seasonal Dynamics of Soil Microbiome in Response to Dry-Wet Alternation along the Jinsha River Dry-hot Valley'
The files contain primary data including soil physicochemical properties and the meteorological data for the study sites, which were recorded from June 2019 to May 2020.
Data in sheet 1: 
Soil pH, total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration, and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P). Sample ID ‘L1-L20’ and ‘N1-N20’ represent soil collected from wet and dry seasons in the dry-hot valleys (DHVs); Sample ID ‘M1-M20’ and ‘D1-D20’ represent soil collected from wet and dry seasons in the transition zones; Sample ID ‘H1-H20’ and ‘T1-T20’ represent soil collected from wet and dry seasons in the alpine zones.
Data in sheet 2: Air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture were recorded from June 2019 to May 2020. The wet season is defined as the period from June to October, while the dry season is defined as the period from November to May.
